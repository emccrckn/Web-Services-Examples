Aladin| Sly Alchemy From That Lamp|3/21/14| Musical|If a genie had sprung from my teakettle last week and offered to grant me three wishes, I might impulsively have asked to be spared any more children’s musicals. 


General of Yore| Pretty General|2/08/14| Historical |  It’s very boring and pedantic


Black Angels over Tuskagee|The Men The Wings|4/21/14| Historical|The one loner, Jerimah Jones (a stern-faced Derek Shaun), makes such a show of his disdain for the others that you know he will soften up after a personal secret is revealed. When the sensitive Quentin (played by Mr. Gray himself, in an ingratiating turn) goes on about his Lucille back home, he telegraphs another plot twist. Quentin’s brother, Abraham, played with tenderness by Thom Scott II, looks out for him, and their relationship is the play’s emotional core.


The Book of Mormon|A Funny Play|1/21/14|Comedy|On my fourth visit to “The Book of Mormon” on a recent night, the show still had me at “Hello,” the first word of the first song in this long-running musical. I had anticipated a certain falling off of religious fervor and discipline in this ebullient satire about naïve Mormon missionaries in Uganda, written and composed by Trey Parker, Robert Lopez and Matt Stone, directed by Mr. Parker and Casey Nicholaw, also its choreographer. Three years is a long time for a peppy musical to stay peppy.


ARTHUR MILLER'S THE CRUCIBLE|Review: In Arthur Miller’s ‘Crucible,’ First They Came for the Witches|3/01/14|Drama|Parallels between Miller’s then and latter-day nows have never been hard to reach for. What makes Mr. van Hove’s interpretation so unsettlingly vivid has little to do with literal-minded topicality.


The Color Purple|Stripped to Its Essence|4/1/14|Drama|Give thanks this morning, children of Broadway, and throw in a hearty hallelujah. “The Color Purple” has been born again, and its conversion is a glory to behold.


Disaster!|Review: Mayhem! Gambling! Disco! In ‘Disaster!’ It’s All There for the Spoofing|1/21/14|Musical|Alert the authorities! There’s a wayward nun on the loose in New York City, committing grand larceny eight times a week.
