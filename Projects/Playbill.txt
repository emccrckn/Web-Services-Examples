Aladin|The Verdict: Critics Review Disney's Aladdin on Broadway|3/24/14|  I give it 1000 stars out of 10!  Great musical!


Black Angels over Tuskagee|Before They were Airmen|4/16/14| HistoricalThe leisurely 2-hour-20-minute play is full of good intentions, decent talent and not an ounce of daring. Mr. Gray, who stages his own work, steers his underdog story so cautiously, moving in the straightest of lines, that you don’t always realize how deftly he’s setting you up. Bracketing this agreeable drama is that old device, the folksy narrator (Antonio D. Charity), who provides historical context and dictionary definitions of racism and segregation. “You see, I believe in the principle that all men are created equal,” he says at the start.


The Book of Mormon|A New Set of Believers, but the Same Peppy Faith|1/17/14|Comedy|Clean living, it would seem, really does keep a body healthy. Just look at those nonsmoking, nondrinking boys in “The Book of Mormon.” They’ve been hanging around in the insalubrious, soul-sapping environs of Broadway for more than three years. Yet they don’t look a day older than when they arrived.


ARTHUR MILLER'S THE CRUCIBLE|Perfectly Timed|4/01/14|Drama|The Devil has returned to Broadway, with the power to make the strong tremble. It is time to be afraid, very afraid, of a play that seemed perhaps merely worthy when you studied it in high school English class.


The Color Purple|Stripped to Its Essence|4/1/14|Drama|The heart-clutching, gospel-flavored musical that opened at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater on Thursday night — in a production led by an incandescent new star named Cynthia Erivo and, in her Broadway debut, an enchanting Jennifer Hudson — share a title, the same characters, the same source of inspiration (Alice Walker’s 1982 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel) and most of the same songs with “The Color Purple” seen on Broadway a decade ago. But, oh, what a difference there is between them.


Disaster!|What a Great Play!|1/24/14|Musical|Perhaps petty larceny is a more appropriate charge, since this self-consciously silly spoof of the cheesy 1970s films that subjected assorted B-list stars to assorted calamities will never rank among the great musicals of our era — or even the great jukebox musicals of our era, a rather small demographic. But for anyone with a moist, albeit mortifying, affection for the oeuvre of that great auteur Irwin Allen (guilty), and the K-Tel era of pop music (guilty), “Disaster!” will provide a rush of giddy nostalgia that’s just as pleasurable, at times, as the more substantial rewards of the musical theater’s higher-reaching shows.


Exit Strategy|School’s Out Forever|5/13/16|Drama|Among the play’s strongest, funniest scenes is its first, a testy meeting between the boyish, tidily dressed assistant principal, Ricky (Ryan Spahn, exuding earnest spunkiness), and a veteran English teacher, Pam (Deirdre Madigan), who glares across the desk that separates them as if she’d like to make a meal of her much younger boss.
